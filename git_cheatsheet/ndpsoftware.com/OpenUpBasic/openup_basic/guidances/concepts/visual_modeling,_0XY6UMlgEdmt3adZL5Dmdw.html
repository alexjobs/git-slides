<p align="center"> Visual modeling raises the level of abstraction </p>
<p> Visual modeling is the use of semantically rich, graphical and textual design 
  notations to capture software designs. A notation, such as UML, allows the level 
  of abstraction to be raised, while maintaining rigorous syntax and semantics. 
  In this way, it improves communication in the design team, as the design is 
  formed and reviewed, allowing the reader to reason about the design, and it 
  provides an unambiguous basis for implementation. </p>
<h3>How visual models help </h3>
<p> A model is a simplified view of a system. It shows the essentials of the system 
  from a particular perspective and hides the nonessential details. Visual models 
  help you:: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Increase understanding of complex systems </li>
  <li> Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost </li>
  <li> Form a foundation for implementation </li>
  <li>Capture requirements precisely </li>
  <li> Communicate decisions unambiguously </li>
</ul>
<h4> Increase understanding of complex systems </h4>
<p> The importance of models increases as systems become more complex. For example, 
  you can build a doghouse without blueprints. However, as you progress to building 
  houses and then to skyscrapers, your need for blueprints becomes pronounced. 
</p>
<p> Similarly, a small application built by one person in a few days may be easily 
  understood in its entirety. However, an e&nbsp;-&nbsp;commerce system with tens 
  of thousands of source lines of code (SLOCs) or an air traffic control system 
  with hundreds of thousands of SLOCs can no longer be easily understood by one 
  person. Constructing models allows a developer to focus on the big picture, 
  understand how components interact, and identify fatal flaws.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Among the various types of models are these examples: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use cases to specify behavior unambiguously </li>
  <li> Class diagrams and data model diagrams to capture design </li>
  <li> State transition diagrams to model dynamic behavior </li>
</ul>
<p> Modeling is important because it helps the team visualize, construct, and 
  document the structure and behavior of the system without getting lost in complexity. 
</p>
<h4> Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost </h4>
<p> You can create and modify simple models inexpensively 
  to explore design alternatives. Innovative ideas can be captured and reviewed 
  by other developers before investing in costly code development. When coupled 
  with iterative development, visual modeling helps developers assess design changes 
  and communicate these changes to the entire development team. </p>
<h4> Form a foundation for implementation </h4>
<p> Today, many projects employ object-oriented programming languages to build 
  reusable, change-tolerant, and stable systems. To get 
  these benefits, it is even more important to use object technology in design. 
</p>
<p> With the support of appropriate tools, you can use a design model to generate 
  an initial code for implementation. This is referred to as <strong>forward engineering 
  </strong>or <strong>code generation</strong>. You can also enhance design models 
  to include enough information to build the system. </p>
<p> <strong>Reverse engineering </strong>may also be applied to generate design 
  models from existing implementations. You can use this method to evaluate existing 
  implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> <strong>Round-trip engineering</strong> combines both forward and reverse 
  engineering techniques to ensure consistent design and code. Combined with an 
  iterative process and the right tools, round-trip engineering allows you to 
  synchronize the design and code during each iteration. </p>
<h4> Capture requirements precisely </h4>
<p> Before building a system, it's critical to capture the requirements. Specifying 
  the requirements using a precise and unambiguous model helps to ensure that 
  all stakeholders can understand and agree on the requirements. </p>
<p> A model that separates the external behavior of the system from the implementation 
  of it helps you focus on the intended use of the system, without getting bogged 
  down in implementation details. </p>
<h4> Communicate decisions unambiguously </h4>
<p> The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is&nbsp;a consistent notation that can 
  be applied for system engineering, as well as for business engineering. According 
  to these excerpts from the UML specification, a standard notation:: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Serves as a language for communicating decisions that are not obvious or 
      cannot be inferred from the code itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Provides semantics that are rich enough to capture all important strategic 
      and tactical decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Offers a form concrete enough for humans to reason [about] and for tools 
      to manipulate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> UML represents the convergence of the best practice in software modeling throughout 
  the object-technology industry. For more information on the UML, see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="../supportingmaterials/references%2c_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[UML05]</a>.</p></td>
