    The items in this checklist represent good practices for creating and communicating a robust design. Try to address
    every item to the greatest extent possible to create the best design. It may not be possible to address every item, and
    some items may only be able to be addressed to a limited extent. In these cases, be sure that there are good reasons
    for only partially addressing an item, or not addressing an item at all.
</p>
<p>
    Design can be performed every day. Use this checklist regularly to assure the design is robust, consistent, and
    understandable. Make the design good enough for the specific goals being addressed by using this checklist to identify
    areas that have been skipped, ignored, or not sufficiently addressed.

<td><p>
    Does the design describe the system at the appropriate level of abstraction, given the objectives? This usually means
    the system is described at a number of different levels of&nbsp;abstraction and perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    Does the design use common vocabulary and terms from the business and technical domains?
</p>
<p>
    Does the design describe the behavior of the elements unambiguously to the extent that developer tests can be created
    toverify the implementation?

    customer's vocabulary is used, and elements of the design are referenced in a consistent manner.
</p>
<p>
    Is the design organized in a way that team members can easily find the information they're looking for?
</p>
Is the notation used to&nbsp;describe the design&nbsp;used consistently?<br />
<p>
    Is the design organized in a way that helps team members modify it without contending for the same part of the design?
    That is, can mulitple people work on the design in parallel?
</p>
<p>
    Are the names of elements within the design consistent and easy to interpret?
</p>
<p>
    Does each design element represent a clearly defined abstraction?

<p>
    Is it easy to navigate between related diagrams?

    Does each diagram focus on a relevant perspective? For instance, does a set of diagrams show a single class and its
    direct relationships, rather than using&nbsp;one or two diagrams to show all classes?

</p>
<p>
    Does the visual model conform to project or organization specific modeling standards?
</p>
Is the visual model internally consistent? For instance, if an object diagram shows a relationship between objects, does a
corresponding relationship exist between the appropriate classes?<br />
<p>
    Does the name of each class clearly reflect the role it plays?
</p>
<p>
    Does each class offer the required behavior?

<p>
    Is there at least one&nbsp;realization association defined for each interface? The realization may represent a 3rd
    party implementation of the subsystem.

<p>
    Are&nbsp;there dependency associations from each subsystem to the interfaces it uses?
</p>
<p>
    Is each operation in a subsystem interface described in a sequence diagram? Or at least mapped directly to an operation
    in a class?

<p>
    Does each class represent a single well defined abstraction?
</p>
<p>
    Are generalization relationships used only to inherit definitions, not behavior (implementation)? In other words, is
    behavior shared through the use of association, aggregation and containment relationships instead of generalization?

    Are parent classes in generalization relationships abstract? Are the "leaf" classes in a generalization hierarchy the
    only concrete classes?

<p>
    Are stereotypes used consistently and meaningfully?
</p>
<p>
    Do&nbsp;statecharts exist for classes with complex or restrictive state changes?
</p>
<p>
    Do relationships have descriptive role or association names (one or the other but not both), and&nbsp;correct
    multiplicities?

    Are relationships between classes unidirectional whenever possible?<br />

    Can the semantics of the modeling language be understood over time? Is the language documented well enough so that team
    members can understand the model long after design decisions have taken place?
</p>
<p>
    Are team members and stakeholders trained in the modeling language being used?
