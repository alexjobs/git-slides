    In general, the architecture must support the needs of the development team for the current iteration:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does the architecture appear to be stabilizing? Although the architecture may be unstable during early Inception
        and Elaboration iterations, it should become more stable toward the end of Elaboration, with sufficient stability
        during Construction to allow the team to build the software efficiently and with confidence. The architecture
        should be very stable during the Transition phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the architecture divide the system’s responsibilities into well-defined subsystems with well-defined
        interfaces?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are all of the subsystem components for the iteration identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the number and types of components reasonable?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the packaging approach reduce complexity and improve understanding?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are packages defined to be highly cohesive within the package, while the packages themselves are loosely coupled?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can team members understand enough from the architecture to successfully design and code their allocated
        components?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the architecture description current?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the design guidelines been followed?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are all technical risks either mitigated or addressed in a contingency plan?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the architecture address all of the non-behavioral requirements in the Supplementary Requirements? If not, is
        there a plan to address them?

    The Use-Case View

    <ul>
      <li> Is vitally important to the stakeholders?</li>
      <li> Motivates key elements in the other views?</li>

  <li> Are there any Use Cases whose architectural concerns are already covered 
    by another Use Case? </li>
  <li> Are the architecturally significant aspects of the Use Case clear, not 
    lost in details? </li>
  <li> Are the Use Cases sufficiently clear and unlikely to change in a way that 
    affects the architecture, or is there a plan in place for how to achieve such 
    clarity and stability? </li>
  <li> Have any architecturally significant Use Cases been missed? <strong>Note: 
    </strong>This may require analysis of the Use Cases not selected for this 
    view.</li>

    defined for the current iteration? </li>

    The Logical View

<p> For the Process View section of the Software Architecture document: </p>

  <li> Are potential race conditions (process <strong></strong>competition for 
    critical resources) identified, and have you defined avoidance and resolution 
    strategies? </li>
    <li>
        Are the nominal and maximal performance requirements for important operations specified?

    <li>
        Is there is a set of performance tests capable of measuring whether performance requirements have been met?

<td><h4>
    Overall
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subsystem and package partitioning and layering is logically consistent.
    </li>
    <li>
        All analysis mechanisms have been identified and described.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Subsystems
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The services (interfaces) of subsystems in upper-level layers have been defined.
    </li>
    <li>
        The dependencies between subsystems and packages correspond to dependency relationships between the contained
        classes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The classes in a subsystem support the services identified for the subsystem.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Classes
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The key entity classes and their relationships have been identified.
    </li>
    <li>
        Relationships between key entity classes have been defined.
    </li>
    <li>
        The name and description of each class clearly reflects the role it plays.
    </li>
    <li>
        The description of each class accurately captures the responsibilities of the class.
    </li>
  <li> The entity classes are mapped to analysis mechanisms, where appropriate. 
  </li>
  <li> The role names of aggregations and associations accurately describe the 
    relationships between the related classes. </li>
    <li>
        The multiplicities of the relationships are correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        The key entity classes and their relationships are consistent with the business model (if it exists), domain model
        (if it exists), requirements, and glossary entries.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    General Model Considerations
</h4>
<ul>
    
  <li> The model is at an appropriate level of detail, given the model objectives. 
  </li>
  <li> For the business, requirements, or design models during the Elaboration 
    phase, there is not an over-emphasis on implementation issues. </li>
  <li> For the design model in the Construction phase, there is a good balance 
    of functionality across the model elements, and it combines 
    relatively simple elements to build a more complex design. </li>
    <li>
        The model demonstrates familiarity and competence with the full breadth of modeling concepts applicable to the
        problem domain; modeling techniques are used appropriately for the problem at hand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Concepts are modeled in the simplest way possible.
    </li>
  <li> The model can easily evolve, and expected changes can be easily accommodated. 
  </li>
  <li> At the same time, the model has not been overly structured to handle unlikely 
    change at the expense of simplicity and comprehensibility. </li>
  <li> The key assumptions that the model is based on are 
    documented and visible to reviewers of the model. If the assumptions are applicable 
    to a given iteration, then the model should be able to evolve within those 
    assumptions, but not necessarily outside of those assumptions. Documenting 
    assumptions is a way of indemnifying designers from not being 
    expected to consider <em>all </em>possible requirements. In an iterative 
    process, it is impossible to analyze all possible requirements and to define 
    a model that will handle every future requirement. </li>
