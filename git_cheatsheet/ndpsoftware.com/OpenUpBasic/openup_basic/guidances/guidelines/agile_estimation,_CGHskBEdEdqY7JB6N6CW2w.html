    Agile Estimation
</h3>
<p>
    There are three main concepts you need to understand to do agile estimation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Size</strong> gives you a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a
        neutral unit such as points
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Velocity</strong> tells us how many points this project team can deliver within an iteration;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Effort</strong> translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort
        typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take
        the team member(s) assigned to the work item to do the work.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Estimation of Size
</h4>
<p>
    Agile estimation of size is typically done using a relative measure called <strong>points</strong>.&nbsp; You decide
    how big a point is, and based on that size, you determine how many points each work item is. To make estimation go
    fast, you want to use only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65
    points. To get started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then
    go through all other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used
    for high-level estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of
    lower priority, since you would then waste effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current
    iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let’s say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack.
    If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big,
    they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours,
    while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do
    it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use
    Velocity to determine how much ‘size’, or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration.
</p>
<p>
    One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the
    same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. You
    hence want to make sure that ideally the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people
    are involved in all your size estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of
    velocity will fix also this discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days. See for example [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="../supportingmaterials/references%2c_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">COH05</a>] for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Velocity
</h4>
<p>
    Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an
    iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team may plan for taking on 20 points in the first
    iteration. At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence
    14. For the next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let’s say 18 points, since they think they can do a little
    better than in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.
</p>
<p>
    You should expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and
    points are not always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems
    end up being harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool
    environment, better teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity.
    In general, velocity typically goes up during the duration of the project, as the team builds skills and becomes more
    cohesive.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let’s assume that project team Alpha
    and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team
    Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points. Team Alpha assesses work item A, B, C,
    and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond to 10 points. Both teams
    deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and team Beta a velocity of
    10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let’s look at what happens when they plan the next iteration.
    They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and team Beta as normal has
    estimated to be 1/3 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many points as indicated by
    their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how big a point is, as long
    as you are consistent within your team.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let’s look at an example; Let’s assume that Ann
    always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3
    points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may
    not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since
    the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on.
    As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can
    hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is
    still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand
    for that iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Estimation of Effort
</h4>
<p>
    As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design, implement and test a scenario, which
    may be sized to 5 points. Typically you at this time break down this still reasonably big work item into a number of
    smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and Testing Server portion,
    and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. You would now do a detailed estimate of the actual effort,
    measured in hours or days, associated with each of those 4 tasks. This estimate should be done by the person assigned
    to do the task. In this case you may assign the following actual estimates (with person responsible within
    parenthesis):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Designing scenario (Ann and Jack):&nbsp; 6 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Total Effort Estimate for Scenario:</strong> 44 hours
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no
    point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often,
    you have to do some level of analysis and design of the work item before you can come up with a reasonable estimate.
    Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to
    re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an
    iteration.<br />
