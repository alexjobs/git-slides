<td class="sectionTableCell"><p> Layering logically partitions the subsystems 
  into a number of sets, with certain rules regarding how relationships can be 
  formed between the layers. Layering provides a way to restrict inter-subsystem 
  dependencies, with the result that the system is more loosely coupled and, therefore, 
  more easily maintained. </p>
<p>
    The criteria for grouping subsystems follow a few patterns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Visibility</b><strong>:</strong> Subsystems may depend only on subsystems 
    in the same layer and the next-lower layer. </li>
  <li> <b>Volatility</b><strong>:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li> <b>In the highest layers</b>, put elements that vary when user requirements 
        change. </li>
      <li> <b>In the lowest layers</b>, put elements that vary when the implementation 
        platform changes (hardware, language, operating system, database, and 
        so forth). </li>
      <li> <strong>Sandwiched in the middle</strong>, put elements that are generally 
        applicable across wide ranges of systems and implementation environments. 
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Add layers </strong>when additional partitions within these 
        broad categories help to organize the model. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Generality</b><strong>: </strong>Abstract model elements tend to be 
    placed lower in the model. If not implementation-specific, they tend to gravitate 
    toward the middle layers. </li>
  <li> <b>Number of layers.</b> For a small system, three layers are sufficient. 
    For a complex system, five to seven layers are usually sufficient. For any 
    degree of complexity, more than 10 layers should be viewed with suspicion 
    that increases with the number of layers. The table that follows gives you 
    a few guidelines. </li>

<p> Failure to restrict dependencies according to Visibility criteria mentioned 
  above can cause architectural degradation and make the system difficult to extend 
  and maintain. </p>
<p> Exceptions include cases where subsystems need direct access to lower-layer 
  services. Make a decision about how to handle primitive services that are needed 
  throughout the system, such as printing, sending messages, and so forth. There 
  is little value in restricting messages to lower layers if the solution is to 
  effectively implement call pass-throughs in the intermediate layers. </p>
<h4> <a id="PartitioningPatterns" name="PartitioningPatterns">Partitioning patterns</a> 
</h4>
<p> Within the top layers of the system, additional partitioning may help organize 
  the model. The following guidelines for partitioning present different issues 
  to consider: </p>
<p><b>User organization</b><strong>: </strong> Subsystems may be organized along 
  lines that mirror the organization of functionality in the business organization 
  (partitioning occurs along departmental lines). This partitioning often occurs 
  early in the design because an existing enterprise model that is strongly partitioned 
  according to the structure of the organization. This pattern usually affects 
  only the top few layers of application-specific services and often disappears 
  as the design evolves. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> Partitioning along user-organization lines can be a good starting point 
      for the model. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> The structure of the user organization is not stable over a long period 
      of time because business reorganizations occur; therefore, it is not a good 
      long-term basis for system partitioning. The internal organization of the 
      system should enable the system to evolve and be maintained independently 
      of the organization of the business that it supports. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Areas of competence and skills: </b>Subsystems may be organized to partition 
  responsibilities for parts of the model among different groups within the development 
  organization. Typically, this occurs in the middle and lower layers of the system, 
  and reflects the need for specialization in skills during the development and 
  support of an infrastructure based on complex technology. 
  Examples of such technologies include network and distribution management, database 
  management, communication management, and process control, among others. Partitioning 
  along competence lines may also occur in upper layers, where special competency 
  in the problem domain is required to understand and support key business functionality. 
  Examples include telecommunication call management, securities trading, insurance 
  claims processing, and air traffic control, to name a few. </p>
<p><b>System distribution: </b> Within any of the layers of the system, the layers 
  may be further partitioned horizontally, so to speak, to reflect the distribution 
  of functionality. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Partitioning to reflect distribution of functionality can help you visualize 
      the network communication that will occur as the system runs. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partitioning to reflect distribution can also, however, make the system 
      more difficult to change if the deployment model changes significantly. 
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Secrecy areas</b><strong>: </strong> Some applications, especially those 
  requiring special security clearance to develop or support, require additional 
  partitioning according to security access privileges. Software that controls 
  access to secrecy areas must be developed and maintained by personnel with appropriate 
  clearance. If the number of people with this background on the project is limited, 
  the functionality requiring special clearance must be partitioned into subsystems 
  that will be developed independently from other subsystems, with the interfaces 
  to the secrecy areas the only visible aspect of these subsystems. </p>
<p><b>Variability areas: </b> Functionality that is likely to be optional, and 
  therefore delivered only in some variants of the system, should be organized 
  into independent subsystems that are developed and delivered independently from 
  the mandatory functionality of the system. </p></td>
