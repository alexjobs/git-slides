</h3>
<p>
    Use the requirements of&nbsp;stakeholders and potential users as vital information to help you find both the actors and
    use cases. As you discover them, briefly describe the use cases and the actors. Before you describe the use cases in
    detail, the use-case model should be reviewed by the stakeholders to verify that you have found all of the use cases
    and actors and that, together, they can provide what the&nbsp;stakeholder wants. For more information on finding actors
    and use cases see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="find_and_outline_actors_and_ucs%2c_eyL0wCu-EdqSxKAVa9kmvA.html" guid="_eyL0wCu-EdqSxKAVa9kmvA">Guideline: Find and Outline Actors and Use Cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When you have found the actors and use cases, describe the flow of events for each use case in detail. These
    descriptions show how the system interacts with the actors and what the system does in each case. In an iterative
    development environment, you will select particular scenarios of the use cases, or parts of a scenario, to be detailed
    in each iteration. For more information on detailing use cases and scenarios, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="detail_ucs_and_scenarios%2c_4BJ_YCxSEdqjsdw1QLH_6Q.html" guid="_4BJ_YCxSEdqjsdw1QLH_6Q">Guideline: Detail Use Cases and Scenarios</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the completed use-case model (including the descriptions of use cases) is reviewed, and the developers
    and&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;use it to agree on what the system should do.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Avoiding Functional Decomposition" name="Avoiding Functional Decomposition">Avoiding Functional
    Decomposition</a>
</h3>
<p>
    It is not uncommon that the use-case model degenerates into a functional decomposition of the system. To avoid this,
    watch for the following symptoms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Small</strong> use cases, meaning that the description of the flow of events is only one or a few
        sentences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Many</strong> use cases, meaning that the number of use cases is some multiple of a hundred, rather than a
        multiple of ten.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use-case names that are constructions such as "do this operation on this particular data" or "do this function with
        this particular data". For example, "Enter Personal Identification Number in an ATM machine" should not be modeled
        as a separate use case for the ATM machine, because no one would use the system to do just this. A use case is a
        complete flow of events that results in something of value to an actor.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To avoid functional decomposition, make sure that the use-case model helps answer these kinds of questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the context of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are you building this system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does the user want the system to do?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;do the users benefit from the system?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Non-Functional Requirements" name="Non-Functional Requirements">Nonfunctional Requirements</a>
</h3>
<p>
    It is quite easy to see that use cases are a very good way of capturing functional requirements on a system. But what
    about the nonfunctional requirements? What are they, and where are they captured?
</p>
<p>
    Usability, reliability, performance, and supportability requirements are often categorized as nonfunctional
    requirements (also see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="supporting_requirements%2c_wr24gNcGEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q.html" guid="_wr24gNcGEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Guideline: Supporting Requirements</a>). They often specify statutory&nbsp;or regulatory
    requirements that you must comply with, by law. They can specify design constraints, such as the operating system used,
    the platform environment, interface requirements, business rules, or any application standards that apply. In general,
    you can say that any requirement that does not allow for more than one design option should be regarded as a design
    constraint.
</p>
<p>
    Many nonfunctional requirements apply to an individual use case and are captured within the flow of events of that use
    case or as a special requirement of that use case (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case%2c_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q.html" guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: Use Case</a>).
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    <strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<p class="example">
    In&nbsp;a recycling machine system, a nonfunctional requirement specific to the Return Deposit Items use case could be:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        The machine must be able to recognize deposit items with a reliability of more than 95%.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Often, the nonfunctional requirements apply to the whole system. Such requirements are captured in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../../workproducts/supporting_requirements%2c_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q.html" guid="_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q">Artifact: Supporting Requirements</a>.

<h3>
    <a id="Structuring the Use-Case Model" name="Structuring the Use-Case Model">Structuring the Use-Case Model</a>
</h3>
<p>
    There are three main reasons for structuring the use-case model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To make the use cases easier to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        To partition common behavior described within many use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        To make the use-case model easier to maintain.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Structuring is not the first thing you do, however. There is no point in structuring the use cases until you know a bit
    more about their behavior than a one-sentence description. You should at least have established a step-by-step outline
    for the flow of events of the use case to make sure that your decisions are based on an accurate understanding of the
    behavior.
</p>
<p>
    To structure the use cases, you use three kinds of relationships. You will use these relationships to factor out pieces
    of use cases that can be reused in other use cases, or that are specializations or options for the use case. The use
    case that represents the modification is called the <b>addition use case</b>. The use case that is modified is called
    the <b>base use case</b>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If there is a part of a base use case that represents only the result of a function that the use case depends on,
        not the method used to produce the result, you can factor that part out to an addition use case. The addition is
        <strong>explicitly</strong> inserted in the base use case, using the <em>include
        relationship</em><strong>.</strong> For more information on the <em>include relationship</em>, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case_model%2c_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there is a part of a base use case that is optional, or it is not necessary to understand the primary purpose of
        the use case, you can factor that part out to an addition use case to simplify the structure of the base use case.
        The addition is <strong>implicitly</strong> inserted in the base use case, using the <em>extend</em>
        relationship.&nbsp;For more information on the <em>extend relationship</em>, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case_model%2c_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are use cases that have commonalities in behavior and structure, as well as similarities in purpose, their
        common parts can be factored out to a base use case (parent) that is inherited by addition use cases (children).
        The child use cases can insert new behavior and modify existing behavior in the structure they inherit from the
        parent use case.&nbsp;For more information on&nbsp;<em>use case generalization</em>, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case_model%2c_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can use <em>actor generalization</em>&nbsp;to show how actors are specializations of one another. For more
    information on <em>actor generalization</em>, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case_model%2c_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    <strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<p class="example">
    Consider part of the use-case model for an order management system.
</p>
<p class="example">
    It is useful to separate an ordinary Customer from an Internet Customer, because they have slightly different
    properties. However, given that Internet Customer does exhibit all properties of a Customer, you can say that Internet
    Customer is a specialization of Customer, which you indicate with an actor generalization.
</p>
<p class="example">
    The concrete use cases in this diagram are Telephone Order (initiated by the Customer actor) and Internet Order
    (initiated by Internet Customer). These use cases are both variations of the more general Place Order use case, which
    in this example is abstract. The Request Catalog use case represents an optional segment of behavior that is not part
    of the primary purpose of Place Order. It has been factored out to an abstract use case to simplify the Place Order use
    case. The Supply Customer Data use case represents a segment of behavior that was also factored out, because it is a
    separate function, and only the result affects the Place Order use case. The Supply Customer Data use case can also be
    reused in other use cases. Both Request Catalog and Supply Customer Data are abstract in this example. Figure 1 is a
    use-case diagram that shows part of the use-case model for an order management system.

    Another aspect of organizing the use-case model for easier understanding is grouping the use cases into packages. The
    use-case model can be organized as a hierarchy of use-case packages. For more information on use-case packages, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="../concepts/use_case_model%2c_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg.html" guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.

<h3>
    <a id="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors" name="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors">Relationship Between Use
    Cases and Actors</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Running each use case includes communication with one or more actors. A use-case instance is always started by an actor
    asking the system to do something. This implies that every use case should have communicates-associations with actors.
    The reason for this rule is to enforce that the system provides only the functionality that users need and nothing
    else. Having use cases that no one requests is an indication that something is wrong in the use-case model or in the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    However, there are some exceptions to this rule:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If a use case is abstract (cannot be instantiated), its behavior may not include interaction with any actor. In
        that case, there will not be any communication-associations to actors from that abstract use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        A child use case in a generalization-relationship does not need to have an actor associated with it if the parent
        use case describes all actor communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        A base use case in an include-relationship does not need to have an actor associated with it if the inclusion use
        case describes all actor communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        A use case may be initiated according to a schedule (for example, once a week or once a day), which means that the
        system clock is the initiator. The system clock is internal to the system; therefore, the use case is not initiated
        by an actor but by an internal system event. If no other actor interaction occurs in the use case, it will not have
        any associations to actors. However, for clarity, you can use <strong>time</strong> as an actor to show how the use
        case is initiated in your use-case diagrams.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="The Survey Description" name="The Survey Description">The Survey Description</a>

<p>
    The survey description of the use-case model should:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>

    <strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<p class="example">
    Following is a sample survey description of the recycling machine's use-case model:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        This model contains three actors and three use cases. The primary use case is <strong>Recycle Items</strong>, which
        represents the main purpose of the recycling machine.
    </p>
    <p class="example">
        These are the supporting use cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Print Daily Report</strong>, which allows an operator to get a report on how many items have been
            recycled.
        </li>
        <li>
            A<strong>dminister Deposit Item</strong>, which allows an operator to change a refund value for a type of
            deposit item or to add new deposit item types.
        </li>
    </ul>
