    Identify architectural goals
</h4>
<p>
    Architectural goals provide the motivation and rationale&nbsp;for decisions. These goals are&nbsp;often driven
    by&nbsp;the software requirements, particularly in&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="../../workproducts/supporting_requirements%2c_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q.html" guid="_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q">Supporting Requirements</a>, because they are not always&nbsp;obvious from&nbsp;the use
    cases alone [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="../supportingmaterials/references%2c_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg.html" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALL02</a>].
</p>
<p>
    Architectural goals define how the system needs to respond to change over time. Consider these questions when writing
    your goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the expected lifespan of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the system need to respond to technological changes over that time, such as new versions of middleware or
        other products?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;frequently is&nbsp;the system&nbsp;expected to adapt to change?
    </li>
    <li>
        What changes can we anticipate in the future, and how can we make them easier to accommodate?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These considerations will have a significant effect on the structure of the system.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify architectural constraints
</h4>
<p>
    Often, the system that you develop will be integrated into an existing environment. To ensure a smooth integration, you
    need to gather information about this environment and identify any architectural constraints.
</p>
<p>
    Architectural constraints can arise from various factors:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Network topology
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of a given database vendor or an existing database
        </li>
        <li>
            Web environment (server configurations, firewall, DMZs, and so forth)
        </li>
        <li>
            Servers (hardware model, operating system)
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of third-party software or a particular technology
        </li>
        <li>
            Compliance with existing standards
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    For example, if the company uses only one type of database, you will probably try to use it as much as possible to
    leverage&nbsp;the existing database administration skills, rather than introducing a new one.
</p>
<p>
    These architectural constraints, combined with the requirements, help you define&nbsp;an appropriate&nbsp;candidate for
    the system architecture.
</p>
<h4>
    Survey, assess, and select from available assets
</h4>
<p>
    To assess and select assets to reuse on your project, you need to understand the requirements of the system's
    environment. You also need to understand the scope and general functionality of the system that the Stakeholders
    require. There are several types of assets to consider, including (but not limited to): reference architectures;
    frameworks; patterns; analysis mechanisms; classes; and experience. You can search asset&nbsp;repositories (internal or
    external to your organization) and industry literature to identify assets or similar projects.
</p>
<p>
    You need to assess whether available assets contribute to solving the key challenges of the current project and whether
    they are compatible with the project's architectural constraints. You also need to analyze the extent of the fit
    between assets and requirements, considering whether any of the requirements are negotiable (to enable use of the
    asset). Also, assess whether the asset could be modified or extended to satisfy requirements, as well as what the
    tradeoffs in adopting it are, in terms of cost, risk, and functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, decide, in principle, whether to use one or more assets, and record the rationale for this decision.
</p>
<h4>
    Define approach for structuring the system
</h4>
<p>
    Structuring your system helps you manage its complexity by using the well-known "divide and conquer" strategy. By
    breaking the process into smaller and more manageable pieces, you make development easier.
</p>
<p>
    Layering&nbsp; is&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;commonly used&nbsp;approaches for structuring and decomposing systems. Each
    layer groups similar classes or components, which communicate insofar as possible only with adjacent layers.
</p>
<p>
    You do not define which layers contain which classes or components. Instead, you define how many layers you will need
    and which kinds of layers you will use. For example, if you are developing a new middleware system, you probably do not
    need a business layer. Later, during&nbsp;design activities, you decide which classes and components will populate
    these layers.
</p>
<h4>
    Develop deployment overview
</h4>
<p>
    Develop a high level overview of how the software is deployed. For example, determine if the system needs to be
    accessed remotely, or has requirements that suggest distribution across multiple nodes. Some sources of information to
    consider are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        users at locations, defined in&nbsp;the Vision and use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        organization of business data
    </li>
    <li>
        service level requirements defined in the Supplementary Specifications.
    </li>
    <li>
        constraints (in the Supplementary Specifications, such as requirements to interface with legacy systems)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Validate that the deployment overview supports users (especially users at remote locations if this is required)
    performing typical use cases while satisfying nonfunctional requirements and constraints. Validate that the nodes and
    connections are adequate to support the interactions between components on different nodes, and between components and
    their stored data.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify key abstractions
</h4>
<p>
    Requirement and analysis tasks usually uncover key concepts that the system must be able to handle. These concepts
    manifest in design as key abstractions.&nbsp;Your <a class="elementLink" href="../../workproducts/vision%2c_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html" guid="_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Vision</a> and <a class="elementLink" href="../../workproducts/glossary%2c_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q.html" guid="_Wn7HcNcEEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Glossary</a> work products are good sources for key abstractions. You can often easily
    identify these abstractions, because they represent things that are significant to the business. For example, Customer
    and Account are typical key abstractions in the banking business.
</p>
<p>
    When you define the key abstractions, also define any obvious relationships that exist between entity classes. You can
    capture these in a table or&nbsp;on UML class diagrams (in a tool or whiteboard), and create a short description for
    each abstraction.&nbsp;In general, it is not worth agonizing over defining a highly detailed set of relationships at
    this early stage in design. The relationships will become more concrete and detailed later and will&nbsp; probably
    modify your initial assumptions.
</p>
<p>
    The classes that you identify at this point will also probably change and evolve during the course of the project. The
    purpose of this step is not to identify a set of classes and relationships that will survive throughout
    design.&nbsp;Rather, it is&nbsp;to identify the key concepts that the system must handle. Don't spend too much time
    describing entity classes in detail at this initial stage, because there is a risk that you will identify classes and
    relationships that the use cases do not actually need. Remember that you will find more entity classes and
    relationships when looking at the use cases.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify analysis mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    See <a class="elementLink" href="../concepts/analysis_mechanism%2c_0gvqoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html" guid="_0gvqoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Analysis Mechanism</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Capture architectural decisions
</h4>
<p>
    It is often useful to record key architectural decisions and working assumptions on an architectural overview diagram
    to make it easier to communicate the architecture to the project team and stakeholders.&nbsp;This information should be
    part of the description of the architecture, but it can vary in format to suit the needs of the project.&nbsp;For
    example, on an agile and low-ceremony project the overview diagram can be an informal picture story board or a graph
    with icons on either a whiteboard or a drawing tool. The illustration needs to show the nature of the proposed
    solution, convey the governing ideas, and represent the major building blocks.
</p>
<p>
    If a more complex system is required, then a more formal and comprehensive set of&nbsp;models that describe the
    architecture from a number of viewpoints is more appropriate. See <a class="elementLink" href="architectural_view%2c_T9nygClEEduLGM8dfVsrKg.html" guid="_T9nygClEEduLGM8dfVsrKg">Architectural View</a>&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    You will find it useful to develop these three Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams at this stage:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Layer map</strong> (represented as a class diagram using packages) that describes the upper-level layers of
        the architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Draft deployment diagram</strong> that outlines the&nbsp;expected network topology
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Simple class diagram</strong> that shows the key abstractions and any obvious relationships among them
    </li>
</ul>
