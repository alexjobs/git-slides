    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small
    subset of requirements.&nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.
</p>
<p>
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some
    scenario.&nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&nbsp;again later&nbsp;to deal with a different context on the
    same requirements.&nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&nbsp;to the users, all
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database
    access, etc.
</p>
<p>
    If this task is being performed on an architecturally significant element the results of this design should be
    referenced by the architecture.

<p>
    Identify the required relationships between the&nbsp;elements based on the walkthrough of the scenario examining how
    the elements initiate each other's behavior. An element that requests behavior from another element is represented as a
    relationship between those elements. As with the responsibilities, these relationships can just be defined at this
    step.

<p>
    Look to the architecture and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Use the Architect to explain
    the details and motivations of the architecture. Look to reuse existing behavior and relations or to apply similar
    structure to simplify the design of the overall system.

    Communicate&nbsp;the design to&nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the end of
    the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than
    reviewing the work after it is complete.
</p>
<p>
    Here are some ways to communicate&nbsp;the design:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Formal models&nbsp;specified in UML .
    </li>
    <li>
        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&nbsp;dynamic behavior.

    <li>
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure supplemented with textual descriptions of
        dynamic behavior across code modules&nbsp;.
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical data models to describe the database schema.

</ul>
<p>
    Here are some examples of individuals&nbsp;who will need to understand the design:

<ul>
    <li>
        Developers&nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.
    </li>
    <li>
        An&nbsp;architect who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the
        design for opportunities to improve the architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.

    <li>
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&nbsp;depend on the
        elements designed in this task.

    <li>
        Other reviewers&nbsp;who will review the design for quality and adherence to standards.

        The structure of tables and views

    Consider the design from various angles to ensure that it is a high-quality, communicable design.&nbsp; Work with other
    technical team members; an independent party can provide a fresh perspective.&nbsp;Use the Tester and Architect to
    provide perspectives on&nbsp;design quality and adherence to the architecture.&nbsp;However, when identifying potential
    reviewers keep in mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even
    more value by actively participating in the design effort itself.

<P>Consider the architecture while performing this task.&nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the architecture within which the design exists.&nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture. </P>
<P>This task will be applied numerous times.&nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.</P>
<P>Even when starting the design for a particular project it&nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and reusable elements.&nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate while designing this portion of the solution. </P>
