    This role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for managing the major
    technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and documenting the
    architecturally significant aspects of the system, including requirements, design, implementation, and deployment
    views.
</p>
<p>
    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various
    stakeholders, reducing technical risks, and ensuring that decisions are effectively communicated, validated, and
    followed.
</p>
<p>
    This role is closely involved in organizing the team around the architecture by working closely with the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="project_manager%2c_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a>&nbsp;in staffing and planning the project.

<th scope="row" class="sectionTableHeading">Skills</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p> Architects must be well-rounded people 
  with maturity, vision, and a depth of experience 
  that allows for grasping issues quickly and making educated, critical judgments 
  in the absence of complete information. More specifically, the person must possess 
  this combination of qualifications: </p>
<ul>
    
  <li> <b>Experience </b><strong>in both problem and software engineering domains</strong>, 
    with evidence of a thorough understanding of the requirements to solve the 
    problem and active participation in software development. If there is a team, 
    this experience can be represented 
    by different team members, but at least one person must be 
    able to provide the overall vision for 
    the project. </li>
  <li> <b>Leadership ability </b>to motivate and maintain momentum for the technical 
    effort across the various teams and to make critical decisions under pressure, 
    plus make those decisions stick. To be effective, this role must have the authority 
    to make technical decisions. </li>
  <li> <b>Excellent communication</b> <strong>skills </strong>to earn trust, persuade, 
    motivate, and mentor.This role cannot lead 
    by decree, but only by the consent of the rest of the project team. 
    To be effective, this&nbsp;person must earn the respect of the team members, 
    the <a class="elementLink" href="project_manager%2c_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a>, the customer, and the user community, as well as the management 
    team. </li>
  <li> <b>Goal-oriented and proactive</b> <strong>orientation</strong> with a 
    relentless focus on results.&nbsp;This person is the technical driving force 
    behind the project, not a visionary or dreamer. The career of a successful 
    architect is a long series of sub-optimal decisions made in uncertainty and 
    under pressure. Only those who can focus on doing what needs to be done will 
    be successful.</li>
</ul>
<p> From an expertise standpoint, this role also needs to show both design and 
  implementation abilities. However, from the design perspective, the effective 
  architect typically exhibits these traits: </p>
<ul>
    
  <li>Tends to be a generalist, rather than a specialist, who 
    knows many technologies at a high level rather than a few technologies at 
    the detail level </li>
  <li> Makes the broader technical decisions, 
    thereby demonstrating broad knowledge and experience, as well as communication 
    and leadership skills</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> 
  <p> "The ideal architect should be a person of letters, a mathematician, familiar 
    with historical studies, a diligent student of philosophy, acquainted with 
    music, not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of jurisconsults, 
    familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations." &#8212; Vitruvius, 
    circa 25 BC </p>

<tr valign="top">
<th scope="row" class="sectionTableHeading">Assignment Approaches</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    This person in this role should be engaged in the project from start to finish.
</p>
<p>
    For smaller projects, a single person may act as both architect and <a class="elementLink" href="project_manager%2c_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Project Manager</a>. However, if possible, it is better to have these roles performed by different people to ensure that time
    pressure in one role doesn't cause neglect of the other role. If you adopt this separate-role approach, both
    individuals must make sure that they work together closely.
</p>
<p>
    If the project is large enough to warrant an architecture team, the goal is to have a good mix of talents that covers a
    broad spectrum of experience and share a common understanding of software engineering process. The architecture team
    should not be a committee of representatives from various teams, domains, or contractors. Software architecture is a
    full-time function, with staff permanently dedicated to it.
