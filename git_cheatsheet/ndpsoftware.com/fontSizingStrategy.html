CSS Font Size Strategies Explored and Explained  </h2>
<p>Maintaining all the different font-sizes for your web site driving you bonkers?
  This article looks at how they behave in the laboratory and makes recommendations
  about how to harness them back in the wild.</p>
<p>This page analyzes <a href="experiment/css/fontSize.html" target="_blank">the experiment found here.</a> It
was originally written circa 2009. It was updated April 2013.</p>

<h3>Background Experiment</h3>
<p>
  I designed this experiment to understand and document the behaviors of the various "font-size" settings available in
  CSS. I created a test page, and then viewed it on various user agents, recording the behavior. I used the <em>View
  &gt; Text Size</em> and captured the behavior.
  <a href="experiment/css/fontSize.html" target="_blank">View the experiment page</a>
</p>

<p>I limited my experiment to the five most popular font-sizing techniques. Yes, I know there are others, but these are
  the
  most common and recommended. I didn't explore the Javascript-enhanced techniques, which help eliminate some of these
  differences. Nor did I explore the "browser-hack" techniques, as my goal
  here is to find a low-maintenance and predictable approach.</p>


<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>The questions that are most interesting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scaling: Do fonts scale if the user picks a new setting from the
    View &gt; Text Size menu?

<h3>Findings When Using Small, Medium, Large keywords</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>The words like "small" and "medium" don't specify a specific size, but are basically good, reasonable choices if you
  don't care about pixel accuracy.</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>These are what they seem: good general size specifications. If you can give up pixel-level control of your web site,
  (or parts of it) this is an excellent technique. Some
  browser (note Firefox) don't enforce a minimum
  size to these values, but the defaults are fine from all my tests.

<h3>Findings When Using Pixels</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>These represent pixels on the screen.</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>Pixels are not actually pixels, but they are consistent and predictable.
  There are all sorts of complications if you really need to know exactly what a pixel
  is (based on screen resolution and browser settings), but if you can live with
  the lie, pixels are predictable.
</p>
<p>
  As you can see on many sites, pixel font sizes vary quite a bit between
  user agents (see <a href="#references">References</a>). In addition, your
  site will react differently to user's changing their font size.
</p>

<h3>Findings When Using Percent</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>These adjust relative to the "default" size of the text.</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>The cascade of CSS dictates what the percent figure means, and it appears
  that user agents tend to follow this. This difficulty with this is that
  the size is relative to another element. The size of an element's font
  depends on its context. If you have deep nesting
  of elements, it is quite common to run into text styled identically ending
  up different sizes because of the nesting. This then results in more styles
  to undo the extra shrinkage.
</p>
<p>
  I also learned that <code>font-size: 1em</code> at regular <em>View &gt; Text Size</em> is the same as
  <code>font-size: 100%</code>. In other words, <code>100%</code> appears to be the equivalent of <code>1em</code>,
  for what it's worth.
</p>
<p>There are all sorts of posts around about "rounding errors" in
  different browsers. I haven't dug into the details of these to understand
  them. There is one particularly annoying bug where fonts go "microscopic" in IE. Watch for it. It's a bad one.</p>
<p>When using this technique, you must be very careful of the nesting
  of the elements. If you set a font size for an div, it will affect all
  elements inside it by multiplying.
</p>
<p>Determining what a workable strategy here is difficult, because of the
  dependencies. I can imagine with a rather fixed and consistent hierarchy of
  elements this technique could be used successfully. Or some strategy to only
  specify font-sizes for "leaf" elements.</p>

<h3>Findings When Using Ems</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>Represent a measurement relative to a default font in the browser.</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>This seems to be detached from the typographical definition of an <strong>em</strong> (in my opinion). What I found
  was that this seems to be implemented identically to the percent measurement, with 1em
  equivalent to 100%. It comes with all those behaviors and problems.
</p>
<p>Like percent, when using this technique, you must be very careful of the nesting
  of the elements. If you set a font size for an div, it will affect all
  elements inside it by multiplying.
</p>
<p>Update as of 2012: <code>rem</code>s is a new unit designed to remove the nesting behavior.</p>

<h3>Findings When Using Hybrid Techniques</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>You find a recommendation to use a combination of pixels and ems and %s on your page. It seems reasonable.</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>Around the web you'll find various recommendations to neutralize these behaviors. A popular and highly recommended
  one I tried (prompting this article) involved setting an enclosing
  font-size on the whole page, like <code>76%</code>, and then using <code>em</code>s
  throughout (magical ems). (This seems to me it's the same as wrapping the page in <code>.76em</code> or using
  percentages universally, but I didn't verify this.) I found that this technique
  ultimately confusing, and didn't solve the problems for me. It's just our site was changing too much, elements were
  nested deeply, and we needed to support a wide array of browsers.</p>


<h3>Recommendations 1: Analyze Your Site</h3>
<p>There are really two important questions to ask before selecting a strategy:</p>
<h4>How critical is it that fonts are consistent size across browsers?</h4>
<p>Don't assume that looking identical across all browser is critical. Think and ask.
  There are many resources addressing this, but it is expensive to achieve. For most sites,
  looking <em>good</em> across
  browsers is a sufficient. Very few people switch between computers and browsers and expect consistency. Do your
  viewers?
</p>
<h4>How precise control do you need over fonts?</h4>
<p>Many designers will start out by fitting elements together in
  PhotoShop so they are precisely positioned. This is costly to replicate on the web in HTML. You should ask how
  critical it is to fill every pixel with content. People are usually viewing quickly and culling small pieces of
  information. Trying to pack lots of stuff on a page ignores this reality of user behavior. Consider a simple,
  spacious layout and limit your content to the essential.
</p>
<h4>How complex and modular is the site design?</h4>
<p>If you have a site with nested modules that can appear in different contexts, that's
  a nice design to implement. But if you using a font-sizing strategy that uses nesting,
  you may end up fighting with your stylesheets.</p>

<h3>Recommendations 2: Select the Simplest Solution</h3>
<p>Once you have a clear understanding of your needs, you can pick the simplest technique to satisfy them.</p>
<p>If you use a design that is fairly <em>flexible</em>, the
  <code>small, medium, large, xx-large</code> keywords are ideal. They won't be
  exactly the same across browsers, but large will be large, small will be large, and xx-small will be nearly
  unreadable. They scale similarly
  across browsers and aren't affected by their surrounding elements. The downside
  is that you only have a certain set of sizes at your disposal (without reverting to some
  other technique). I have adopted this for all my work.</p>

<p><strong>Precise Layout</strong> Here's a general approach when the flexible design is not appropriate.
<ul>
  <li>If you have a fairly fixed element hierarchy, <code>em</code>s or percents may work well for you.
    Spend some time up-front
    coming up with a strategy and writing down the rules.
  </li>
  <li>If you have a fairly flexible element hierarchy, you may need to design more of the styles up-front.</li>
  <li>After you've developed most of the pages for Firefox, assess where you are in IE. If you are pretty close,
    judiciously use browser hacks.
  </li>
  <li>If your site looks awful in IE, consider developing separate style sheets for each browsers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend <code>px</code> measurements, since they behave so differently between the two
  most popular user agents.</p>

<h3>Testing Font-Sizing Strategies</h3>
<h4>What you might think</h4>
<p>Building the page with
  <del>Firefox</del>
  (update: Chrome) and previewing it with IE is a good approach.
</p>
<h4>The reality</h4>
<p>Yes, this is great. But you must do more. The other important factors are:
<ul>
  <li>the browser version: IE 6 differs quite a bit form IE 5 and 5.5 in how it renders fonts. Firefox 1.5 differs from
    earlier versions.
  </li>
  <li>operating system: not only Mac and Windows, but make sure you test XP and Windows 2000 separately (I am told).
  </li>
  <li>the "Text Size" option available in the View menu for most browsers. Some people will browse the web in "small" so
    they can maximize the usage of their pixels, while others must browse at "large" size for visual comfort. No matter
    what your site is, you probably should support these people, since they make up a large segment. You may be able to
    ignore the extremes.
  </li>
</ul>
