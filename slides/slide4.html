<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 20px;"> The basic Git workflow :</p>
<ol>
    <li> You modify files in your working directory. (git checkout branch)</li>
    <li>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area. (git add files)</li>
    <li>
        You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores
        that snapshot permanently to your Git directory. (git commit -m 'comment')
    </li>
</ol>
