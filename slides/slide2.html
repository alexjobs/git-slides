<h3>Types of Version Control Systems</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Centralized Version Control Systems :- <br />
        In Centralized Version Control, We have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients
        that check out files from that central place. Ex:- CVS, Subversion, and Per-force.<br /><br />
    </li>

        Distributed Version Control Systems:-<br />
        In distributed version control, each user has their own copy of the entire repository, not just the files but the history as well.
        Ex:- Git, Mercurial, Bazaar
